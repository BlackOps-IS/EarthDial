## SCRIPT

### HOOK (0-8 seconds)
[FACE TO CAMERA]
"What if we could prevent wildfires before they start — not just react after? That's exactly what I built with NVIDIA Nemotron. Let me show you EarthDial."

### THE PROBLEM (8-18 seconds)
[FACE TO CAMERA, or show news footage of Sonoma fires]
"In 2017, the Tubbs Fire killed 22 people in Sonoma County. An aging power line, high vegetation, 45 mile-per-hour Diablo winds — conditions that were all predictable. The ignition was preventable. But nobody had a system to make the right decision fast enough."

### THE MAP (18-35 seconds)
[CUT TO SCREEN RECORDING — 3D threat map]
"This is EarthDial — a 3D ignition risk surface rendered in real time. Each red column shows where the probability of a fire starting is highest. The blue arcs are the power grid. The dots are hospitals, shelters, and emergency services."

[ROTATE THE MAP slightly to show 3D depth]
"This isn't a static risk map. It responds to wind, humidity, fuel conditions, and the state of the power grid — all computed in real time."

### THE MAGIC (35-55 seconds)
[SCREEN RECORDING — Grid Control tab]
"Here's where it gets powerful. I hit 'Compute Optimal Plans' — the system runs GPU-accelerated graph optimization to find the best power lines to shut off."

[CLICK apply plan]
"Watch what happens when I apply the top plan..."

[SWITCH to Counterfactual tab — show risk reduction metrics]
"Ignition risk drops. Extreme risk cells are eliminated. And the best part — hospitals and shelters stay powered."

[CLICK 'Explain this counterfactual']
"NVIDIA Nemotron explains exactly why this works, what the tradeoffs are, and how confident it is."

### THE NEMOTRON BRIEF (55-65 seconds)
[SWITCH to Prevention Brief tab]
"And Nemotron generates a full prevention order — actions, timing, evidence, equity review — ready for an operator to act on immediately."

### THE CLOSE (65-80 seconds)
[FACE TO CAMERA]
"EarthDial uses NVIDIA Nemotron for reasoning, GPU-accelerated graph optimization for decision-making, and it's designed to plug into NVIDIA Earth-2's weather ensemble forecasts."

"This is the future of disaster prevention — and NVIDIA's technology makes it possible. The whole project is open source."

"Carter, Nader — thank you for this opportunity. I'd love to bring EarthDial to GTC."

## RECORDING TIPS:
1. Film face shots with good lighting (window or ring light)
2. Screen record at http://localhost:8501
3. Connect to Nemotron BEFORE recording (so the connection is ready)
4. Pre-load the data (open the app first, let it compute)
5. The 3D map is the hero shot — make it fill the screen
6. Rotate/pan the map during recording for cinematic effect
7. Cut between face and screen smoothly
8. Add captions (most LinkedIn viewers watch muted)

## SCREEN RECORDING FLOW:
1. Open http://localhost:8501 — show the 3D map (linger 3-4 seconds)
2. Slowly rotate the map view
3. Click to Grid Control tab
4. Click "Compute Optimal Plans" — show results
5. Click "Apply Plan #1" 
6. Switch to Counterfactual tab — show before/after metrics
7. Click "Explain this counterfactual" — show Nemotron output
8. Switch to Prevention Brief — generate and show
9. Flash the Weather Timeline charts

## EDITING:
- Use jump cuts between face and screen
- Add subtle background music (ambient/tech)
- Put your face in corner overlay during screen recording
- Text overlays for key stats ("17 extreme risk cells eliminated")
