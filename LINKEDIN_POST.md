Earth-2 predicts the planet.
EarthDial decides what to do about it.

Today I'm launching EarthDial.ai — an open-source AI Decision Intelligence platform for planetary systems, built on NVIDIA Nemotron.

The problem: Weather AI can now forecast disasters with extraordinary accuracy. But a forecast doesn't shut off a power line. A forecast doesn't reroute an evacuation. A forecast doesn't protect a hospital.

The gap between prediction and prevention kills people.

EarthDial closes that gap.

Here's what it does:

→ Ingests real-time weather and terrain data across 1,600+ terrain cells
→ Computes Rothermel-inspired ignition risk surfaces in real time
→ Runs GPU-accelerated graph optimization to find surgical infrastructure interventions
→ Uses NVIDIA Nemotron (Llama-3.3 Super 49B) to generate operator-ready prevention orders
→ Proves every decision with counterfactual simulation: "If we do X, risk drops by Y — here's why"

This is not a chatbot wrapper.
This is not a dashboard with an LLM bolted on.

This is a decision engine.

The live demo runs automatically when you visit earthdial.ai — narrated, cinematic, 2 minutes. Then you take control and explore the full system yourself.

Technical stack:
• NVIDIA Nemotron for causal reasoning (not generation — reasoning)
• GPU-accelerated graph optimization (NetworkX → cuGraph production path)
• Earth-2 compatible forecast ingestion
• PyDeck 3D visualization with cinematic camera system
• Fully open source (MIT license)

The wildfire scenario is the proof of concept. The architecture is hazard-agnostic. Floods. Earthquakes. Industrial accidents. Grid failures. Any domain where you need to go from forecast to decision in real time.
