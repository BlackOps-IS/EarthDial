🌍 Introducing EarthDial v3 — an open-source wildfire prevention system powered by NVIDIA Nemotron and GPU-accelerated graph optimization.

Most wildfire systems react after ignition. EarthDial prevents ignition before it happens.

Here's what it does:

🗺️ 3D Ignition Risk Surface — real-time, spatially-resolved risk columns rendered over terrain
⚡ Intelligent De-Energization — graph-optimized power shutoffs that minimize fire risk while preserving hospitals, shelters, and emergency comms
🔄 Counterfactual Simulator — toggle a power line shutoff and watch the risk surface respond live
📋 AI Prevention Briefs — NVIDIA Nemotron generates operator-ready prevention orders grounded in evidence, with confidence intervals and equity review
📈 72-Hour Forecast Integration — Diablo wind event modeling with escalating risk timeline

The tech stack:
🟢 NVIDIA Nemotron (Llama 3.3 Super 49B) — reasoning, prevention briefs, counterfactual explanations
🟢 GPU-accelerated graph optimization (cuGraph-compatible) — surgical de-energization
🟢 PyDeck 3D visualization — Omniverse-style threat rendering
🟢 Designed for the NVIDIA Earth-2 ecosystem
🟢 100% open source

Why this matters: The 2017 Tubbs Fire killed 22 people in Sonoma County. An aging power line, high vegetation, Diablo winds — conditions that were predictable. The ignition was preventable.

EarthDial is the first open-source system that compiles real-time reality into an uncertainty-aware world model and uses GPU-scale counterfactuals to recommend prevention actions — not just response.
