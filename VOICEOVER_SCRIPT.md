What if we could prevent wildfires — before they start?

This is EarthDial version three. A wildfire prevention and counterfactual decision system — built on NVIDIA Nemotron and GPU-accelerated graph optimization.

Right now, you're looking at Sonoma County, California. Sixteen hundred terrain cells, each analyzed in real-time. The red columns you see? Those are extreme ignition risk zones — driven by forty-five mile per hour Diablo winds, eight percent humidity, and ninety-eight degree heat. This is a Red Flag Warning.

The blue arcs are live power transmission lines. Every one of them is a potential ignition source. Our risk engine scores each line using vegetation encroachment, equipment age, wind interaction, and voltage — all weighted and computed simultaneously.

Now watch. Our GPU graph optimizer evaluates every possible combination of power shutoffs — and finds the surgical cut that maximizes risk reduction while keeping hospitals, shelters, and emergency services online. No brute force guessing. Intelligent de-energization.

Here's the counterfactual. On the left — before intervention. On the right — after. Risk drops. Extreme cells eliminated. And this isn't a simulation — this is a decision engine. Every action is explainable, every tradeoff is quantified.

Finally — Nemotron. NVIDIA's Llama three point three Nemotron Super forty-nine B takes all of this data — the risk surface, the weather, the shutoff plan, the affected facilities — and generates a formal, operator-ready prevention brief. Not a suggestion. A prevention order. Actionable, evidence-grounded, equity-aware.

This is EarthDial. Prevention, not response. Built with NVIDIA.

## AI VOICE GENERATION

Use one of these services to generate the voiceover with your cloned voice:
1. **ElevenLabs** (elevenlabs.io) — Best quality. Upload 1-3 min of your voice to clone.
2. **Play.ht** (play.ht) — Good alternative with voice cloning.
3. **Resemble.ai** — Another option with API access.

### Steps:
1. Record 2+ minutes of yourself reading anything naturally
2. Upload to ElevenLabs → Create voice clone
3. Paste the full script above into the text-to-speech
4. Generate → Download MP3
5. Sync with screen recording using the timestamp guide

## SCREEN RECORDING TIPS
- Use **OBS Studio** (free) or Windows Game Bar (Win+G)
- Resolution: 1920×1080 minimum, 4K preferred
- Record at 60fps for smooth scrolling
- Open browser in fullscreen (F11)
- Move mouse slowly and deliberately — the judges will follow your cursor
- Open at http://localhost:8503

### Recording Flow:
1. Start OBS recording
2. Play voiceover audio
3. Browser shows Phase 1 — 3D map is visible
4. At 0:22 → Click NEXT (Phase 2: Grid Analysis)
5. At 0:38 → Click NEXT (Phase 3: AI Optimization)
6. Wait for plans to auto-compute
7. At 0:52 → Click NEXT (Phase 4: Counterfactual)
8. At 1:10 → Click NEXT (Phase 5: Prevention Brief)
9. Click Generate Brief button
10. At 1:30 → End recording
11. Show "TAKE CONTROL" button being clicked as a bonus ending

## LINKEDIN POST (Updated)

```
I built a wildfire prevention system powered by NVIDIA Nemotron.

🔥 EarthDial v3 doesn't just detect fires — it prevents them.

Using GPU-accelerated graph optimization and NVIDIA's Llama-3.3-Nemotron-Super-49B, it:
→ Computes real-time ignition risk across 1,600 terrain cells
→ Finds surgical power shutoff plans that minimize fire risk while keeping hospitals online
→ Generates operator-ready prevention briefs — not just alerts
→ Runs counterfactual simulations: "What if we de-energize this line?"

This is prevention, not response. Built with NVIDIA technology.
